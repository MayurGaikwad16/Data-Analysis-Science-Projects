    "### 1. How do you define success for your fraud detection model?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans.  Success is defined not just by high accuracy, but by the model's ability to detect fraud with minimal false positives. In real terms, it means catching fraudulent transactions without burdening genuine users—striking that balance is key. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. What are the key challenges expected during the implementation of this model?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans.  Some challenges include imbalanced datasets (fraud cases are rare), changing fraud patterns, data quality issues, and making sure the model doesn’t flag too many legitimate transactions as fraud.\n"

    "### 1. How do you handle multicollinearity in your dataset?\n",
    "Ans.  In this dataset we check for high correlation between features using metrics like the correlation matrix. If needed, we remove or combine variables to ensure they don’t distort the model’s interpretation or performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. What role does feature importance play in your analysis?\n",
    "Ans.  Feature importance helps us understand which variables influence the model most. It’s useful for refining the model, communicating with stakeholders, and ensuring the model makes decisions for the right reasons.\n"

    "### 1. What techniques are used to handle categorical data?\n",
    "Ans.  Common techniques include one-hot encoding, label encoding, or target encoding, depending on the nature of the data and the model used. The goal is to convert categories into a numerical format without losing their meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Why is it important to split the dataset into training and testing sets?\n",
    "Ans.  It’s crucial to evaluate how the model performs on data it hasn’t seen before. This helps us catch overfitting early and ensures the model generalizes well to real-world scenarios.\n"

    "### 1. How does Gaussian Naive Bayes differ from other variants of Naive Bayes?\n",
    "Ans.  Gaussian Naive Bayes assumes the features follow a normal distribution, which works well for continuous data. Other variants, like Multinomial or Bernoulli, are better for count or binary data, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. What strategies are used to optimize model parameters?\n",

    "### 1. How do you ensure the reliability of your evaluation metrics?\n",
    "Ans.  We use a mix of metrics (precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC) and validate using cross-validation. Especially in fraud detection, recall is critical since missing a fraudulent case can be costly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. What is the impact of false positives and false negatives in fraud detection?\n",
    "Ans.  False positives can annoy legitimate customers and lead to lost trust. False negatives mean fraudulent transactions slip through, causing financial loss. Both are serious, so the model needs to minimize both, with an emphasis on reducing false negatives.\n"
